The problem is that the numbers exported by the current kernels are nearly meaningless. The reported `virtual size` of an application is nearly irrelevant; it says nothing about how much of that virtual space is actually being used.\
The `resident set size` (RSS) number is a little better, but there is no information on sharing of pages there.\
The `/proc/pid/smaps` file gives a bit of detail, but also lacks sharing information. 

 The "proportional set size" (PSS) of a process is the count of pages it has in memory, where each page is divided by the number of processes sharing it. So if a process has 1000 pages all to itself, and 1000 shared with one other process, its PSS will be 1500. The unique set size (USS), instead, is a simple count of unshared pages. It is, for all practical purposes, the number of pages which will be returned to the system if the process is killed.

top
```
The top command is useful to check memory and CPU usage per process. It displays information about:
  * uptime
  * average load
  * tasks running
  * number of users logged in
  * number of CPUs/CPU utilization
  * memory/swap system processes

### The detailed description listed below provides an explanation for each value in case you need assistance in analyzing the results.

* Procs
  * r: number of processes waiting for run time.
  * b: number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.

* Memory
  * swpd: amount of virtual memory used.
  * free: amount of idle memory.
  * buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
  * cache: amount of memory used as cache.
  * 
* Swap
  * si: memory swapped in from disk (/s).
  * so: memory swapped to disk (/s).
* IO
  * bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
  * bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).
* System
  * in: number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
  * cs: number of context switches per second.

* CPU â€“ These are percentages of total CPU time.
  * us: Time spent running non-kernel code. (user time, including nice time)
  * sy: Time spent running kernel code. (system time)
  * id: Time spent idle. Before Linux 2.5.41, this includes IO-wait time.
wa: Time spent waiting for IO. Before Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
st: Time stolen from a virtual machine. Before Linux 2.6.11, unknown.
