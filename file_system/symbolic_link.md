 It is useful for maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the __copies; instead, a link points__ to the original copy.
 There are two types of links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link __points__ to a file is one of the differences between a __hard__ and __symbolic__ link.
 
 Parameters:
 -f If the proposed link (link_name) already exists, then unlink it so that the link may occur.
