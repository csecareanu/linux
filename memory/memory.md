## Process information pseudo-filesystem (/proc)

The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data structures.  It is commonly mounted at /proc.  Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.

### /proc/[pid]/cmdline
This  read-only file holds the complete command line for the process, unless the process is a zombie.

### /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter
See "man core"

### /proc/[pid]/cpuset
See "man cpuset"

### /proc/[pid]/cwd
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.  To find out the current working directory of process 20, for instance, you can do this:\
` $ cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd`

### /proc/[pid]/environ
This file contains the environment for the process. The entries are separated by null bytes ('\0'), and there may be a null byte at the end. 
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:\
`$ strings /proc/1/environ`

### /proc/[pid]/exe
This file is a symbolic link containing the actual pathname of the executed command.

### /proc/[pid]/fd/
 This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2
              standard error, and so on.

              For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries will be symbolic links whose content is the file type with the inode.  A readlink(2) call on this file returns a string in the format:

                  type:[inode]

              For example, socket:[2248868] will be a socket and its inode is 2248868.  For sockets, that inode can be used to find more information in one of the files under /proc/net/.

              For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode (e.g., file descriptors produced by epoll_create(2), eventfd(2), inotify_init(2), signalfd(2), and timerfd(2)), the entry will be a symbolic link with contents
              of the form

                  anon_inode:<file-type>

              In some cases, the file-type is surrounded by square brackets.

              For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link whose content is the string anon_inode:[eventpoll].

top
```
The top command is useful to check memory and CPU usage per process. It displays information about:
  * uptime
  * average load
  * tasks running
  * number of users logged in
  * number of CPUs/CPU utilization
  * memory/swap system processes

### The detailed description listed below provides an explanation for each value in case you need assistance in analyzing the results.

* Procs
  * r: number of processes waiting for run time.
  * b: number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.

* Memory
  * swpd: amount of virtual memory used.
  * free: amount of idle memory.
  * buff: the amount of memory used as buffers.
  * cache: amount of memory used as cache.
  * 
* Swap
  * si: memory swapped in from disk (/s).
  * so: memory swapped to disk (/s).
* IO
  * bi: Blocks received from a block device (blocks/s).
  * bo: Blocks sent to a block device (blocks/s).
* System
  * in: number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
  * cs: number of context switches per second.

* CPU â€“ These are percentages of total CPU time.
  * us: Time spent running non-kernel code. (user time, including nice time)
  * sy: Time spent running kernel code. (system time)
  * id: Time spent idle. Before Linux 2.5.41, this includes IO-wait time.
wa: Time spent waiting for IO. Before Linux 2.5.41, included in idle.
st: Time stolen from a virtual machine. Before Linux 2.6.11, unknown.
